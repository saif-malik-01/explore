Here's an example of how you might update the README.md to include fake but realistic numbers and measures to reduce load time:

# Project Overview

This project is a web application built with React.js for showcasing various AI models deployed by organizations and developers. The application allows users to explore available models, view model details, search for models, and interact with model sandboxes.

## JavaScript Framework and Packages

- **Framework**: React.js
- **Major Plugins/Packages**:
  - react-router-dom for routing
  - react-icons for icons
  - react-syntax-highlighter for syntax highlighting
  - Testing Library for testing components
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Page Load Time

The page load time of the application was measured using the browser's developer tools and various online performance testing tools. On average, the initial page load time is around 1.5-2 seconds for a first-time visitor and around 0.5-1 second for subsequent visits due to caching.

## Measures to Reduce Load Time

1. **Code Splitting**: React's lazy loading and code splitting were used to load components only when needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times.
2. **Minification and Compression**: Static assets were minified and compressed to reduce file sizes and improve loading speed.
3. **Network Optimization**: Network requests were optimized by reducing the number of requests, using HTTP/2, and optimizing server responses to reduce load times.


These measures help decrease the load time and improve the performance of the application.
